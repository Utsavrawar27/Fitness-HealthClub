## XP Core Values
<ol>
  <li><b>Communication</b>: 
    We followed the sprint cycle where we had scrum call on regular basis on Zoom to understand the progress of the project along with discussing the impediments if any. This really helped all the team members to be on same page and understand the complete modules of the project.And also our team held scrum meetings every week on Saturday and Wednesday. We discussed our progress and dealt with dependence concerns and other roadblocks during the call. To keep track of our user stories and manage the project, we used Project Dashboard. </li> </br>
<li><b>Simplicity</b>: We tried to keep the code as simple as possible to be easily picked up by anyone going through it. We discussed the technology to be used among the team and decided on a structured approach to put both the frontend and backend code. This way it became easy for all the team members to organize their piece of code inside the repo.</li></br>
<li><b>Feedback</b>: We had regular scrum calls to take the feedback on the approaches taken by any individual for their requirement. We also did peer review of the code inside the team. In which we generated pull requests and reviewed the code changes of the team member and provided feedback if any. We did peer testing to suggest any changes if needed. We believed in providing valuable feedback to the team.This mindset has helped the team to create a better product</li></br>
<li><b>Courage</b>: We tried to ram-up on the technologies being used in project and learn best from the teammates.</li></br>
<li><b>Respect</b>: We respected each other's time and contribution and helped team members if anyone got stuck anywhere. During the process of selecting technological stacks, team members acknowledged each other's viewpoints and ideas.</li>
</ol>

## Scrum Meeting
We held bi-weekly meetings, with each sprint starting on a Monday and lasting two weeks. Each team member committed to spending 20 hours per sprint, or 10 hours per week, on project activities. We also decided to rotate the role of Scrum Master for each sprint, offering each team member a chance to lead and bring unique ideas to the table.</br>
